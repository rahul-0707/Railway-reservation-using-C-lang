Railway reservation system using C language and Concepts of Data Structure with file Handling with Linked list

# 1.Introduction

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a complete set of information about the system on which the developed project will be running. It includes all the hardware as well as the software requirement. The minimum system requirement as well as the recommended system requirement for running the software are also mentioned in detail separately. The aim of this document is to gather and analyze and give an in-depth insight of the complete software requirement of the Railway reservation system.

## 1.1	Objective

## 2. Abstract
In the Railway reservation system, we have tried to develop a platform to make the reservation system more efficient, easier and fast. It explains the systematic procedure of railway reservation in India. This project is developed using the C language. Which the best and the most used language in the Procedure oriented programing languages. Various functions and structures are used to make a best use of this language.

Railway reservation system enables us to do the train reservation and other things there is necessity to fill a form at the railway reservation counter, that is the user can directly select from the choices provided with train numbers, origin, date of travel, departure time, destination, arrival time at that station, the class of travel, insurance etc. The program gives user the final output as train ticket with the amount to be paid. Finally, it’s the user who has to decide whether to book the ticket or not.

The railway reservation system is used for booking the ticket, searching for the trains, checking the availability of the seats, for doing the tatkal reservation and for the cancellation of the ticket. The most important facility provided in this system is of the insurance policy, that is the passenger will get the financial support if any accident of train or other thing happened during the travel. 

This railway reservation system is beneficial to all the user who have to book the ticket online instead of standing in the long queues at the reservation counter. This system can also be used by the Railway reservation authorities for doing the reservations.
