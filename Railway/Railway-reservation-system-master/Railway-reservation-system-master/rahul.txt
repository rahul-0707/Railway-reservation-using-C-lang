To run this C project, follow these steps:

1. **Install a C Compiler**  
    Make sure you have a C compiler installed, such as GCC (MinGW for Windows) or Turbo C.

2. **Place All Files Together**  
    Ensure `main.c` and all required data files (like `Railway_database.txt`, `Admin.txt`, etc.) are in the same directory.

3. **Compile the Code**  
    Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory and run:
    ```
    gcc main.c -o railway.exe
    ```
    Or, if you use Turbo C, open the project and compile using the IDE.

4. **Run the Program**  
    After compiling, run:
    ```
    railway.exe
    ```
    or
    ```
    ./railway.exe
    ```

5. **Note**  
    - The program uses `getch()`, which may require `<conio.h>`. If you get errors, add `#include <conio.h>` at the top.
    - Run the program in a terminal that supports input/output as expected by the code.
    - Some features may require you to create empty text files (like `Admin.txt`) before first run.
